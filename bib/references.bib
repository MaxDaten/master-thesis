@inproceedings{olsson:Shadows:2014,
	Abstract = { Recently, several algorithms have been introduced that enable real-time performance for many lights in applications such as games. In this paper, we explore the use of 
hardware-supported virtual cube-map shadows to efficiently implement high-quality shadows from hundreds of light sources in real time and within a bounded memory footprint. 
In addition, we explore the utility of ray tracing for shadows from many lights and present a hybrid algorithm combining ray tracing with cube maps to exploit their respective 
strengths. Our solution supports real-time performance with hundreds of lights in fully dynamic high-detail scenes.},
