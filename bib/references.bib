@inproceedings{ClusteredShading2012,
	Abstract = {
		 This paper presents and investigates Clustered Shading for deferred
		 and forward rendering. In Clustered Shading, view samples with similar
		 properties (e.g. 3D-position and/or normal) are grouped into clusters.
		 This is comparable to tiled shading, where view samples are grouped
		 into tiles based on 2D-position only. We show that Clustered Shading
		 creates a better mapping of light sources to view samples than tiled
		 shading, resulting in a significant reduction of lighting computations
		 during shading. Additionally, Clustered Shading enables using normal
		 information to perform per-cluster back-face culling of lights, again
		 reducing the number of lighting computations. We also show that
		 Clustered Shading not only outperforms tiled shading in many scenes,
		 but also exhibits better worst case behaviour under tricky conditions
		 (e.g. when looking at high-frequency geometry with large
		 discontinuities in depth). Additionally, Clustered Shading enables
		 real-time scenes with two to three orders of magnitudes more lights
		 than previously feasible (up to around one million light sources).},

@inproceedings{olsson:Shadows:2014,
	Abstract = { Recently, several algorithms have been introduced that enable real-time performance for many lights in applications such as games. In this paper, we explore the use of 
hardware-supported virtual cube-map shadows to efficiently implement high-quality shadows from hundreds of light sources in real time and within a bounded memory footprint. 
In addition, we explore the utility of ray tracing for shadows from many lights and present a hybrid algorithm combining ray tracing with cube maps to exploit their respective 
strengths. Our solution supports real-time performance with hundreds of lights in fully dynamic high-detail scenes.},
