abstract = {A new BRDF model is presented which can be viewed as an kind of intermediary model between empirism and theory. Main results of physics are observed (energy conservation, reciprocity rule, microfacet theory) and numerous phenomena involved in light reflection are accounted for, in a physically plausible way (incoherent and coherent reflection, spectrum modifications, anisotropy, self-shadowing, multiple surface and subsurface reflection, differences between homogeneous and heterogeneous materials). The model has been especially intended for computer graphics applications and therefore includes two main features : simplicity (a small number of intuitively understandable parameters controls the model) and efficiency (the formulation provides adequation to Monte-Carlo rendering techniques and/or hardware implementations).

abstract = {The notion of arrow by Hughes is an axiomatization of the algebraic structure possessed by structured computations in general. We claim that an arrow also serves as a basic component calculus for composing state-based systems as components-in fact, it is a categorified version of arrow that does so. In this paper, following the second author's previous work with Heunen, Jacobs and Sokolova, we prove that a certain coalgebraic modeling of components-which generalizes Barbosa's-indeed carries such arrow structure. Our coalgebraic modeling of components is parametrized by an arrow A that specifies computational structure exhibited by components; it turns out that it is this arrow structure of A that is lifted and realizes the (categorified) arrow structure on components. The lifting is described using the first author's recent characterization of an arrow as an internal strong monad in Prof, the bicategory of small categories and profunctors. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

This function, especially for metals where the refraction index becomes a complex number, is rather computation intensive. This paper presents and accurate simplification, which can also cope with complex refraction indices. In order to establish the approximation, Schlick's formula is rescaled and the residual error is compensated by a simple rational approximation. The resulting formula can present realistic metals and is simple enough to be implemented on the vertex or pixel shader, and used in games.},

abstract = {Microfacet models have proven very successful for modeling light reflection from rough surfaces. In this paper we review microfacet theory and demonstrate how it can be extended to simulate transmission through rough surfaces such as etched glass. We compare the resulting transmission model to measured data from several real surfaces and discuss appropriate choices for the microfacet distribution and shadowing-masking functions. Since rendering transmission through media requires tracking light that crosses at least two interfaces, good importance sampling is a practical necessity. Therefore, we also describe efficient schemes for sampling the microfacet models and the corresponding probability density functions.

@article{Heitz2014,
abstract = {We give a new presentation of the masking-shadowing functions in microfacet-based BRDFs and answer some common questions about their applications. We use the fact that the masking function (or geometric attenuation factor) is constrained by the visible projected area of the microsurface onto the outgoing direction to derive the properties of the exact masking function. We introduce the distribution of visible normals from the microsurface, whose normalization factor is the masking function, and we show how the common form of microfacet-based BRDFs emerges from this distribution. The consequence of this is that only exact masking functions ensure correct normalization of microfacet-based BRDFs. However, the exact masking function that satisfies these properties can be determined only if a microsurface profile is chosen. Our derivation emphasizes that under the assumptions of their respective microsurface profiles, Smith's and the historical V-cavity masking functions are both exact. However, we show that the V-cavity microsurface is closer to a normal map than a displacement map. This intuition explains why this non-realistic model is responsible for wrong specular highlights at grazing view angles. The insights gained from these observations motivate new research directions in the field of microfacet theory. For instance, we show that masking functions are stretch invariant and we show how this property can be used to derive the masking function for anisotropic microsurfaces in a straightforward way. We also discuss future work such as the incorporation of multiple scattering on the microsurface into BRDF models.},

@misc{MacLane1998,
abstract = {Categories for the Working Mathematician provides an array of general ideas useful in a wide variety of fields. Starting from the foundations, this book illuminates the concepts of category, functor, natural transformation, and duality. The book then turns to adjoint functors, which provide a description of universal constructions, an analysis of the representations of functors by sets of morphisms, and a means of manipulating direct and inverse limits. These categorical concepts are extensively illustrated in the remaining chapters, which include many applications of the basic existence theorem for adjoint functors. The categories of algebraic systems are constructed from certain adjoint-like data and characterized by Beck's theorem. After considering a variety of applications, the book continues with the construction and exploitation of Kan extensions. This second edition includes a number of revisions and additions, including two new chapters on topics of active interest. One is on symmetric monoidal categories and braided monoidal categories and the coherence theorems for them. The second describes 2-categories and the higher dimensional categories which have recently come into prominence. The bibliography has also been expanded to cover some of the many other recent advances concerning categories.},

@article{Burley2012,
abstract = {Following our success with physically-based hair shading on Tangled [27], we began considering physically- based shading models for a broader range of materials. With the physically-based hair model, we were able to achieve a great degree of visual richness while maintaining artistic control. However, it proved challenging to integrate the lighting of the hair with the rest of the scene which had still used tradi- tional “ad-hoc” shading models and punctual lights. For subsequent films we wanted to increase the richness of all of our materials while making lighting responses more consistent between materials and environments and also wanted to improve artist productivity through the use of simplified controls. When we began our investigation it wasn’t obvious which models to use or even how physically- based we wanted to be. Should we be perfectly energy conserving? Should we favor physical parameters like index-of-refraction? For diffuse, Lambert seemed to be the accepted norm, while specular seemed to get most of the attention in the literature. Some models such as Ashikhmin-Shirley (2000) [3] aimed to be intuitive and practical while physically plausible, while others such as He et al. (1991) [12] provided a more comprehensive physical model. Still others aimed at improved data fitting [15, 14, 22, 17, 4], but few of these are appropriate for direct manipulation. We could have implemented several models and let the artists choose and combine them, but then we’d have been back to the parameter explosion we were trying to get away from. One study of a large variety of measured materials was Ngan et al. (2005) [21] which compared five popular models. Some models fared better than others overall, but interestingly, there was a strong correlation between the models’ performances – some materials were well represented by all the models, and for others, no model proved suitable. Adding an additional specular lobe helped in only a few of the cases. This begs the question, what is not being represented in the difficult materials? To answer this question and to evaluate BRDF models more intuitively we developed a new BRDF viewer that could display and compare both measured and analytic BRDFs. We discovered new, intu- itive ways to view measured BRDF data and we found interesting features in the measured materials that weren’t well-represented by known models. In these course notes we will share observations from studying measured materials along with insights we’ve gleaned about which models fit the measured data and where they fall short. We will then present our new model which is now being used on all current productions. We will also describe our experience of adopting this new model in production and discuss how we were able to add the right level of artistic control while preserving simplicity and robustness.},
